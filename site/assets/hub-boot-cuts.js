// The cuts of the boot-sequence hero: the variants under review, in one place
// so the hero (hub-boot.js) and the contact sheet (site/hero-variants.html)
// read the same list. A page picks one with `?v=<name>`; no parameter resolves
// to CUTS[0] — the FIRST entry, which is what makes the default a one-line
// move. That entry is `ship`, so the landing page plays the composed story;
// `hold`, the original, is still selectable as `?v=hold`.
//
// Six independent behaviours compose into the ten cuts, each named in the
// hero's own render loop:
//   grow    the hub arrives simple and gains columns: one chat lane, then the
//           chat list, then the panel — complexity revealed, not dumped
//   chatter the chat keeps living after the reveal: one row types, speaks and
//           fades, then the next line takes its turn
//   perch   the terminal column collapses and he hops up beside the headline
//   zen     the held end state breathes: every element drifts on its own slow
//           clock, randomised so nothing pulses in unison
//   tabs    act two: once the hub is alone on the stage it tours the clients —
//           ChatGPT answers a question, Claude writes the code, Superbot says it
//           can do better and does, each in that vendor's own palette
//   pace    stretches wall time without moving a beat, for a softer merge
